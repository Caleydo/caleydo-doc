Installation
=============

Caleydo currently does not require you to install anything. Just download it for your platform and unpack the archive. You will now have a caleydo folder. To start Caleydo, run the Caleydo.exe on Windows, the Caleydo executable on Linux which is in this folder. On Mac run caleydo/Caledyo.app/Contents/MacOS/Caleydo. That's it!

If you just want to try out caleydo, you can also try the webstart version, which is also available on the download page. Webstart lets you try Caleydo with only one click, independent of you platform. However, the webstart version tends to be a bit problematic sometimes, so if you're having troubles, go with the regular download.

Java
-----
Remeber that Caleydo requires you to have Oracle's Java runtime environment (version 6 or more recent) installed. Mac OS comes with Java pre-installed, so you'll be fine if you use Mac. If you're using Windows and don't have Java installed go here .

For Linux users: note that we only support Oracle's reference implementation, NOT OpenJDK. This doesn't mean that OpenJDK won't work. We simply haven't tested it. You can get RPMs and tar.gz files here . For Ubuntu/Debian there is no packaged version of Java 7 currently available. For options go here .

Requirements
-------------
As Caleydo deals with large amounts of data and uses high-end computer graphics to display content, you will need somewhat recent hardware, operating systems and graphics-card drivers. For details see the System Requiremetns section on the "download"../../download-caleydo page.
