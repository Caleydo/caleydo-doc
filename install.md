#Installation

##Hardware Requirements
As Caleydo deals with large amounts of data and uses high-end computer graphics to display content, you will need somewhat recent hardware, operating systems and graphics-card drivers. For details see the System Requirements section on the [download](http://www.icg.tugraz.at/project/caleydo/download-caleydo) page.

##Dependency: Java
Remember that Caleydo requires you to have a Java runtime environment (version 7 or more recent) installed. You can get Java [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html).

On Mac OS X you have to manually install Java 7 JDK (NOT the JRE!) from Oracle on Macs to get Caleydo working. Otherwise Mac OS does not recognize the correctly installed Java versions. On Windows you can use either JDK or JRE. 

On Linux Caleydo works fine with OpenJDK, an open source Java implementation largely identical with the official Oracle JDK that is part of many distributions. 

##Required Steps
When installing Caleydo on Linux or Windows you can either simply run Caleydo or install it. Installing will associated Caleydo projects files with Caleydo and add Caleydo to your programs, while just running Caleydo is easier if you just want to try it out! 

To *just run* Caleydo without installation download the zip versions for your platform and unpack the archive. You will now have a caleydo folder. To start Caleydo, run the Caleydo.exe on Windows, the Caleydo executable on Linux which is in this folder.  To run Caleydo on Mac OS X, simply double-click the Caleydo app. When running Caleydo for the first time on Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion), shift + right click the Caleydo app and then select "Open" from the menu and confirm that you want to run the application. That's it!

To *install* Caleydo on Windows choose the installer (exe file) form the download page and run the installer. On Linux we currently provide debian packages. On Mac OS X, simply drag the Caleydo app into your "Applications" folder.
